      "description": "With events in 2020 dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, economies around the world saw a sharp slowdown. A number of regions, including Africa, proved relatively resilient. The challenging operating environment also underlined the solidity of Morocco's financial system and that of its institutions which, supported by the country's banking authority, Bank Al-Maghrib, were successfully met. Furthermore, the Bank's business lines have undergone a transformation due to the development of digital banking. The various innovations made have proved a real asset in managing the business in a context of reduced mobility due to the pandemic. In what was an unprecedented year, BANK OF AFRICA's solid fundamentals and appropriate strategic choices in terms of geographic diversification were underlined, so too, its astuteness in the technological choices made previously."

    "paragraph1": "BANK OF AFRICA's wholehearted commitment to its stakeholders in Morocco and Africa is best illustrated by the exemplary manner in which it has responded to the historic COVID-19 pandemic. To deal with this unprecedented environment and its repercussions, strong and rapid responses have been provided by the Moroccan State under the high instructions of His Majesty King Mohammed VI. As one of Morocco's major banking groups, BANK OF AFRICA's response to the national emergency has been equally strong, notably through its contribution of one billion dirhams to the special fund for pandemic management.",
    "paragraph2": "Targeted support has thus been offered to the national economic fabric, particularly to VSMEs, through a global financing envelope of more than 14 billion dirhams and the provision of specific measures and adapted products to our customers.",
    "paragraph3": "While implementing exceptional measures to protect our employees and customers, we have also established a business continuity plan to reduce the impact of the crisis on our various businesses.",
    "paragraph4": "Thus, BANK OF AFRICA has demonstrated its resilience and confirmed the solidity of its economic model and the accuracy of its strategic choices.",
    "paragraph5": "We continued to grow our business in 2020 with outstanding consolidated loans up 4% at MAD 194 billion and maintained savings with total consolidated deposits of MAD 207 billion, up 2% at end-December 2020. This commercial momentum was also reflected in the operational performance of the BANK OF AFRICA Group, with consolidated net banking income of MAD 14 billion, up 1%.",
    "paragraph6": "As a pioneer in digital banking, an essential component of banking and social inclusion, BANK OF AFRICA reaffirmed its position in 2020 as a banking group resolutely focused on the future, with the development of new scalable remote banking services. Our customers, individuals, professionals and businesses, both in Morocco and in several of our African countries of operation, have been able to benefit from various channels to carry out their operations and now have a range of simple and fluid innovative solutions, in a context where remote services have become essential."
